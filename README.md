This is a personal website that showcases my skills, interests, and projects. I created this website as a learning experience and a way to express myself.

## About Me

I'm a constant learner with a passion for Technology and Business. I'm always looking for new ways to expand my knowledge. Currently, pursuing BCA from JIMS, Vasant Kunj (IP University). I'm confident in my ability to learn new skills and to apply them to my work. I'm also a quick learner and I'm able to adapt to new situations quickly.

I like to design simple and professional designs.

I love to code in my own way, and enjoy the coding time.

My parents and Siblings always support me.
